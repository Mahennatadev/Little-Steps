# Little-Steps  (PROJECT FIX TERDAPAT DI FOLDER PROJECT)
This platform emerges in response to the United Nations' Three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically Goal 3, "Good Health and Well-being." With a focus on both physical and mental health, this platform aims to provide a holistic solution concerning child nutrition, child-rearing, and maternal depression. Recognizing the challenges faced by pregnant women and those caring for children aged 1-10 years, the platform offers practical guidance in creating nutrition plans, provides support for child care, and offers information on maternal depression. While the primary goal is to address SDG 3, the platform is also committed to shaping good parents by empowering them through comprehensive guidance and support. With the hope of enhancing the mental and physical well-being of mothers and their children, this platform makes a tangible contribution to achieving SDG 3 and supporting the positive role of parents in educating and caring for their children.
